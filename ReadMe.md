# Java Training School Simulator

A simple simulation of a Java training school. This school will admit students and they will receive training by a team of specialist instructors. The Java training school may bear some superficial similarities to a real school but is grossly simplified and in most cases likely to be quite different to how a real school might work. The aim of this project is to practise Java OOP 


# How to run the simulation
- Open terminal/cmd and navigate to the directory of the .java files. 
- Compile Administrator with javac Administrator.java and then type java Administrator <name of configuration file> <the number of days the simulation is to be run>.

# Example
<bold> java Administrator config.txt 2000 </bold> will run the simulation 2000 days with starting values based on the configuration file.

If the user does not specify the number of days of the simulation, the default value is 1.
